## Astronomy Picture of the Day Search  

### 1. Color Palette: Grayscale
**Decision**: The entire website adheres to a grayscale color palette.

**Rationale**: 
- Ensures a minimalist and timeless look.
- Helps the user focus on the content without color distractions.
- Evokes a sense of nostalgia and elegance.

### 2. Image of the Day
**Decision**: A prominent display of the "Image of the Day" at the center of the page.

**Rationale**:
- The central focus of the website is the daily image.
- Ensures users immediately notice the primary content.

### 3. Descriptive Text
**Decision**: Accompanying text below the image provides context and description.

**Rationale**:
- Gives users an understanding and appreciation of the image.
- Enhances user engagement and educates about the image's significance.

### 4. Print and Download Buttons
**Decision**: Two buttons placed below the image - one for downloading and the other for printing.

**Rationale**:
- Facilitates easy accessibility for users who want a physical copy or a digital version for offline viewing.
- The grayscale design of the buttons maintains the consistency of the website's theme.

### 5. Typography
**Decision**: Use of sans-serif fonts for a modern look with ample white space.

**Rationale**:
- Sans-serif fonts are clean, readable, and look contemporary.
- White space around text ensures readability and balances the design.

## PROCESS
- I started by creating HTML and CSS files.
- Added an images folder.
- Generated HTML code for a heading, an image, and a paragraph.
- Added buttons using JavaScript functions.
- Added CSS to style the site, with media queries to make it responsive to varying screen sizes.
